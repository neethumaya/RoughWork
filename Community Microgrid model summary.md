Chapter 3 - Experimental methodology describes the models for 
- Energy storage sharing using a third party operator 
- P2P energy sharing using multi-user coalition
## Model for Energy storage sharing using third party operator
**Objective Function -** 
$`\min \sum_{t=1}^{T}\left(p(t) \cdot\left(x^{+}(t)+y(t)\right)+\beta \cdot x^{+}(t)\right)`$
